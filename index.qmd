This website covers the [R](https://www.r-project.org) implementation of some of the concepts discussed in class.
We automatically generate multiple versions of the content for your convenience.
However, only the [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com) slides are presented in class and are therefore checked for rendering issues.

# Getting started with R

1. Download the [R console](https://www.r-project.org)
2. Download an editor:
   1. **Recommended**: [R Studio Desktop](https://posit.co/downloads/)
   2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) + [R Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=REditorSupport.r)
   3. [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org) or [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) (see below)

## Optional

If you are already familiar with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) you can install a kernel for R. Open R in a terminal (do not use the R.app in MacOS) and run the following:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("IRkernel")
IRkernel::installspec()
```

Now you can open the downloaded `.ipynb` file and execute it.
