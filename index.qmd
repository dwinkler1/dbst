This webiste covers the [R](https://www.r-project.org) implementation of some of the concepts discussed in class.
We automatically generate multiple versions of the content for your convenience.
However, only the [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com) slides are presented in class and are therefore checked for rendering issues.
To run the code yourself we recommend you download the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) version which can be conveniently run using either [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) or [Jupyter Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
